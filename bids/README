# Data for Age-Related Differences in Social Closeness and Trust
This repository contains code related to our manuscript, tentatively titled "Neural Responses to Reciprocated Trust in Older and Younger Adults".

## Notes
- repository only contains trustgame data. Other task data will be released alongside papers.
- sub-2** participants only have behavioral data. These were the friends during the trustgame
