<dt>Anatomical data preprocessing</dt>
<dd><p>A total of 1 T1-weighted (T1w) images were found within the input BIDS dataset.The T1-weighted (T1w) image was corrected for intensity non-uniformity (INU) with <code>N4BiasFieldCorrection</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="n4">(Tustison et al. 2010)</span>, distributed with ANTs 2.2.0 <span class="citation" data-cites="ants">(Avants et al. 2008, RRID:SCR_004757)</span>, and used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow. The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped with a <em>Nipype</em> implementation of the <code>antsBrainExtraction.sh</code> workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs as target template. Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using <code>fast</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="fsl_fast">(FSL 5.0.9, RRID:SCR_002823, Zhang, Brady, and Smith 2001)</span>. Volume-based spatial normalization to one standard space (MNI152NLin2009cAsym) was performed through nonlinear registration with <code>antsRegistration</code> (ANTs 2.2.0), using brain-extracted versions of both T1w reference and the T1w template. The following template was selected for spatial normalization: <em>ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c</em> [<span class="citation" data-cites="mni152nlin2009casym">Fonov et al.

<dt>Functional data preprocessing</dt>
<dd><p>For each of the 5 BOLD runs found per subject (across all tasks and sessions), the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of <em>fMRIPrep</em>. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using <code>mcflirt</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="mcflirt">(FSL 5.0.9, Jenkinson et al. 2002)</span>. BOLD runs were slice-time corrected using <code>3dTshift</code> from AFNI 20160207 <span class="citation" data-cites="afni">(Cox and Hyde 1997, RRID:SCR_005927)</span>. A B0-nonuniformity map (or <em>fieldmap</em>) was estimated based on a phase-difference map calculated with a dual-echo GRE (gradient-recall echo) sequence, processed with a custom workflow of <em>SDCFlows</em> inspired by the <a href="http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~greve/fbirn/b0/epidewarp.fsl"><code>epidewarp.fsl</code> script</a> and further improvements in HCP Pipelines <span class="citation" data-cites="hcppipelines">(Glasser et al. 2013)</span>. The <em>fieldmap</em> was then co-registered to the target EPI (echo-planar imaging) reference run and converted to a displacements field map (amenable to registration tools such as ANTs) with FSL’s <code>fugue</code> and other <em>SDCflows</em> tools. Based on the estimated susceptibility distortion, a corrected EPI (echo-planar imaging) reference was calculated for a more accurate co-registration with the anatomical reference. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using <code>flirt</code> <span class="citation" data-cites="flirt">(FSL 5.0.9, Jenkinson and Smith 2001)</span> with the boundary-based registration <span class="citation" data-cites="bbr">(Greve and Fischl 2009)</span> cost-function. Co-registration was configured with nine degrees of freedom to account for distortions remaining in the BOLD reference. The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied) were resampled onto their original, native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for head-motion and susceptibility distortions. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as <em>preprocessed BOLD in original space</em>, or just <em>preprocessed BOLD</em>. The BOLD time-series were resampled into standard space, generating a <em>preprocessed BOLD run in MNI152NLin2009cAsym space</em>. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of <em>fMRIPrep</em>. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the <em>preprocessed BOLD</em>: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and three region-wise global signals. FD was computed using two formulations following Power (absolute sum of relative motions, <span class="citation" data-cites="power_fd_dvars">Power et al. (2014)</span>) and Jenkinson (relative root mean square displacement between affines, <span class="citation" data-cites="mcflirt">Jenkinson et al. (2002)</span>). FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their implementations in <em>Nipype</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="power_fd_dvars">(following the definitions by Power et al. 2014)</span>. The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks. Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise correction <span class="citation" data-cites="compcor">(<em>CompCor</em>, Behzadi et al. 2007)</span>. Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the <em>preprocessed BOLD</em> time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with 128s cut-off) for the two <em>CompCor</em> variants: temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 5% variable voxels within a mask covering the subcortical regions. This subcortical mask is obtained by heavily eroding the brain mask, which ensures it does not include cortical GM regions. For aCompCor, components are calculated within the intersection of the aforementioned mask and the union of CSF and WM masks calculated in T1w space, after their projection to the native space of each functional run (using the inverse BOLD-to-T1w transformation). Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks. For each CompCor decomposition, the <em>k</em> components with the largest singular values are retained, such that the retained components’ time series are sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from consideration. The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds file. The confound time series derived from head motion estimates and global signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives and quadratic terms for each <span class="citation" data-cites="confounds_satterthwaite_2013">(Satterthwaite et al. 2013)</span>. Frames that exceeded a threshold of 0.5 mm FD or 1.5 standardised DVARS were annotated as motion outliers. All resamplings can be performed with <em>a single interpolation step</em> by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e. head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using <code>antsApplyTransforms</code> (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels <span class="citation" data-cites="lanczos">(Lanczos 1964)</span>. Non-gridded (surface) resamplings were performed using <code>mri_vol2surf</code> (FreeSurfer).</p>
